Here’s a README template for your Monaco-based code editor with autocomplete functionality for JavaScript and React:

Monaco Code Editor with Autocomplete for JavaScript and React
This is a web-based code editor built using Monaco Editor integrated with React. It provides an enhanced coding experience with autocompletion functionality specifically designed for JavaScript and React. The editor supports features such as syntax highlighting, autocompletion for common JavaScript functions, React component autocompletion, and JSX support.

Features
JavaScript Autocomplete: Includes common JavaScript methods like console.log() and useState().
React Autocomplete: Supports React component autocompletion (e.g., <div>, <Button />).
JSX Support: Provides autocompletion and syntax highlighting for JSX.
Customizable: Easily extendable with additional languages, snippets, and configurations.
Technologies Used
Monaco Editor: Monaco Editor is the core editor for the web-based IDE, providing features like syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and more.
React: The frontend UI is built using React for efficient rendering and component-based development.
Monaco API: Uses Monaco's API to configure the editor, register languages, and provide autocomplete suggestions.
